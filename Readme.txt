# Birthday Circuit Project

Built by: Ashwin Kirubakaran

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a Birthday Circuit that displays my birthday using a combination of logic circuits, counters, and a 7-segment display. The project aims to showcase the ability to create interactive electronics while learning about digital logic. I built this project for my Electrical/Computer Engineering Project, and spent a week building this. 

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- 74193 4-bit Up/Down Counter
- 7-segment Display
- Switches
- Potentiometer
- 555 Timer
- Various Resistors and Capacitors
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware & Code Setup**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to the circuit.
   - Add the 74193 4-bit up/down counter with the Arduino, and connect to the inputs of the Arduino. 
   - Connect the 7-segment display to the output pins of the Arduino.
   - Connect a potentiometer for controlling the speed of the display.
   - Connect a 555 timer to automate the project. 
   - Write your code in the Arduino IDE, and compile/upload it to the Arduino Nano. 

## Code Explanation
- The code initializes input and output pins.
- It continuously checks the states of the input switches.
- Based on the input conditions, the corresponding numbers or symbols related to my birthday are displayed on the 7-segment display.
